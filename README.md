# Epicycles Fourier Transform
 Epicycles using Fourier Transform
 
##1.Parse a SVG file from streaming assets, into a Vector2 path list,
##2.Perform IDFT on the individual X, and Y coordinates of path to obtain the results encoded with the freq, amp and phase of a sinewave
##3.Reconstruct sine waves using freq, amp and phase, display them as combination of Epiccycles
##4.Flip between Displaying Epicycles of IDFT(x) and IDFT(y) seperately, and combined
